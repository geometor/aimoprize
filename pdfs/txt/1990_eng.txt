1. Chords AB and CD of a circle intersect at a point E inside the circle. Let M
be an interior point of the segment EB. The tangent line at E to the circle
through D, E, and M intersects the lines BC and AC at F and G, respectively.
If
AM
= t,
AB
find
EG
EF
in terms of t.
2. Let n ≥ 3 and consider a set E of 2n − 1 distinct points on a circle. Suppose
that exactly k of these points are to be colored black. Such a coloring is “good”
if there is at least one pair of black points such that the interior of one of the
arcs between them contains exactly n points from E. Find the smallest value
of k so that every such coloring of k points of E is good.
3. Determine all integers n > 1 such that
2n + 1
n2
is an integer.

4. Let Q+ be the set of positive rational numbers. Construct a function f : Q+ →
Q+ such that
f (x)
f (xf (y)) =
y
for all x, y in Q+ .
5. Given an initial integer n0 > 1, two players, A and B, choose integers n1 , n2 ,
n3 , . . . alternately according to the following rules:
Knowing n2k , A chooses any integer n2k+1 such that
n2k ≤ n2k+1 ≤ n22k .
Knowing n2k+1 , B chooses any integer n2k+2 such that
n2k+1
n2k+2
is a prime raised to a positive integer power.
Player A wins the game by choosing the number 1990; player B wins by choosing
the number 1. For which n0 does:
(a) A have a winning strategy?
(b) B have a winning strategy?
(c) Neither player have a winning strategy?
6. Prove that there exists a convex 1990-gon with the following two properties:
(a) All angles are equal.
(b) The lengths of the 1990 sides are the numbers 12 , 22 , 32 , . . . , 19902 in some
order.
