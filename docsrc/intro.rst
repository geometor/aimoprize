``geometor-aimoprize`` 

Today, I am starting a journey into the unknown. I am embarking on a mission to
build a machine that can solve mathematical problems. With absolute precision.
To the degree that it is capable of receiving a gold medal at the International
Mathematical Olympiad.

The project is inspired by the AIMO Prize. As they say, "a new $10mn challenge
fund, the Artificial Intelligence Mathematical Olympiad Prize (AIMO Prize). The
fund intends to spur the development of AI models that can reason
mathematically"

I started the GEOMETOR project in 2015 as a hobby, mostly driven out of my
interest in the golden ratio.  I was initially intrigued with methods of
constructing a golden section with just a straight edge and a compass on paper.
It turns out there are many ways to do it. With my golden ratio calipers, I
began to see that if one golden section appeared, there were often others.

Since then, the question has been how to create a framework for proving that
each identified golden sections is accurate and true. 

I knew that to understand the patterns of what is happening require more
accurate and rigorous models. I began exploring computer based geoemtric models
and reteaching myself algebra. 

Today, we have the GEOMETOR foundation, a suite of python modules for modeling,
rendering and analyzing complex classical geometric constructions.
