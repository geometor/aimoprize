1. In the convex quadrilateral ABCD, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular
and the opposite sides AB and DC are not parallel. Suppose that the point P ,
where the perpendicular bisectors of AB and DC meet, is inside ABCD. Prove
that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if the triangles ABP and CDP
have equal areas.
2. In a competition, there are a contestants and b judges, where b ≥ 3 is an odd
integer. Each judge rates each contestant as either “pass” or “fail”. Suppose k
is a number such that, for any two judges, their ratings coincide for at most k
contestants. Prove that k/a ≥ (b − 1)/(2b).
3. For any positive integer n, let d(n) denote the number of positive divisors
of n (including 1 and n itself). Determine all positive integers k such that
d(n2 )/d(n) = k for some n.

4. Determine all pairs (a, b) of positive integers such that ab2 + b + 7 divides
a2 b + a + b.
5. Let I be the incenter of triangle ABC. Let the incircle of ABC touch the sides
BC, CA, and AB at K, L, and M , respectively. The line through B parallel
to M K meets the lines LM and LK at R and S, respectively. Prove that angle
RIS is acute.
6. Consider all functions f from the set N of all positive integers into itself satisfying f (t2 f (s)) = s(f (t))2 for all s and t in N . Determine the least possible
value of f (1998).
