34nd International Mathematical Olympiad
July 18, 1993
First Day
Time Limit: 4 12 hours
1. Let f (x) = xn + 5xn−1 + 3, where n > 1 is an integer. Prove that f (x)
cannot be expressed as the product of two nonconstant polynomials
with integer coefficients.
2. Let D be a point inside acute triangle ABC such that 6 ADB =
6 ACB + π/2 and AC · BD = AD · BC.
(a) Calculate the ratio (AB · CD)/(AC · BD).
(b) Prove that the tangents at C to the circumcircles of 4ACD and
4BCD are perpendicular.
3. On an infinite chessboard, a game is played as follows. At the start, n2
pieces are arranged on the chessboard in an n by n block of adjoining
squares, one piece in each square. A move in the game is a jump in
a horizontal or vertical direction over an adjacent occupied square to
an unoccupied square immediately beyond. The piece which has been
jumped over is removed.
Find those values of n for which the game can end with only one piece
remaining on the board.
Second Day
July 19, 1993
Time Limit: 4 12 hours
1. For three points P, Q, R in the plane, we define m(P QR) as the minimum length of the three altitudes of 4P QR. (If the points are
collinear, we set m(P QR) = 0.)
Prove that for points A, B, C, X in the plane,
m(ABC) ≤ m(ABX) + m(AXC) + m(XBC).
2. Does there exist a function f : N → N such that f (1) = 2, f (f (n)) =
f (n) + n for all n ∈ N, and f (n) < f (n + 1) for all n ∈ N?

3. There are n lamps L0 , . . . , Ln−1 in a circle (n > 1), where we denote
Ln+k = Lk . (A lamp at all times is either on or off.) Perform steps
s0 , s1 , . . . as follows: at step si , if Li−1 is lit, switch Li from on to off or
vice versa, otherwise do nothing. Initially all lamps are on. Show that:
(a) There is a positive integer M (n) such that after M (n) steps all
the lamps are on again;
(b) If n = 2k , we can take M (n) = n2 − 1;
(c) If n = 2k + 1, we can take M (n) = n2 − n + 1.
