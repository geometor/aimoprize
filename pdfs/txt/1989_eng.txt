1. Prove that the set {1, 2, . . . , 1989} can be expressed as the disjoint union of
subsets Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , 117) such that:
(i) Each Ai contains 17 elements;
(ii) The sum of all the elements in each Ai is the same.
2. In an acute-angled triangle ABC the internal bisector of angle A meets the
circumcircle of the triangle again at A1 . Points B1 and C1 are defined similarly.
Let A0 be the point of intersection of the line AA1 with the external bisectors
of angles B and C. Points B0 and C0 are defined similarly. Prove that:
(i) The area of the triangle A0 B0 C0 is twice the area of the hexagon AC1 BA1 CB1 .
(ii) The area of the triangle A0 B0 C0 is at least four times the area of the
triangle ABC.
3. Let n and k be positive integers and let S be a set of n points in the plane such
that
(i) No three points of S are collinear, and
(ii) For any point P of S there are at least k points of S equidistant from P .
Prove that:
k<

1 √
+ 2n.

4. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral such that the sides AB, AD, BC satisfy
AB = AD + BC. There exists a point P inside the quadrilateral at a distance
h from the line CD such that AP = h + AD and BP = h + BC. Show that:

5. Prove that for each positive integer n there exist n consecutive positive integers
none of which is an integral power of a prime number.
6. A permutation (x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ) of the set {1, 2, . . . , 2n}, where n is a positive
integer, is said to have property P if |xi − xi+1 | = n for at least one i in
{1, 2, . . . , 2n − 1}. Show that, for each n, there are more permutations with
property P than without.
