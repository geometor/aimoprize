Find the smallest natural number n which has the following properties:
(a) Its decimal representation has 6 as the last digit.
(b) If the last digit 6 is erased and placed in front of the remaining digits,
the resulting number is four times as large as the original number n.

Consider the cube ABCDA0 B 0 C 0 D0 (ABCD and A0 B 0 C 0 D0 are the upper and
lower bases, respectively, and edges AA0 , BB 0 , CC 0 , DD0 are parallel). The
point X moves at constant speed along the perimeter of the square ABCD
in the direction ABCDA, and the point Y moves at the same rate along
the perimeter of the square B 0 C 0 CB in the direction B 0 C 0 CBB 0 . Points X
and Y begin their motion at the same instant from the starting positions A
and B 0 , respectively. Determine and draw the locus of the midpoints of the
segments XY.

Solve the equation cos2 x + cos2 2x + cos2 3x = 1.

1962/5.
On the circle K there are given three distinct points A, B, C. Construct (using
only straightedge and compasses) a fourth point D on K such that a circle
can be inscribed in the quadrilateral thus obtained.

1962/6.
Consider an isosceles triangle. Let r be the radius of its circumscribed circle
and ρ the radius of its inscribed circle. Prove that the distance d between
the centers of these two circles is

The tetrahedron SABC has the following property: there exist five spheres,
each tangent to the edges SA, SB, SC, BCCA, AB, or to their extensions.
(a) Prove that the tetrahedron SABC is regular.
(b) Prove conversely that for every regular tetrahedron five such spheres
exist.
