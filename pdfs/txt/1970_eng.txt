Let a, b and n be integers greater than 1, and let a and b be the bases of
two number systems. An−1 and An are numbers in the system with base a,
and Bn−1 and Bn are numbers in the system with base b; these are related as
follows:
An = xn xn−1 · · · x0 , An−1 = xn−1 xn−2 · · · x0 ,
Bn = xn xn−1 · · · x0 , Bn−1 = xn−1 xn−2 · · · x0 ,
xn 6= 0, xn−1 6= 0.
Prove:

1970/4.
Find the set of all positive integers n with the property that the set {n, n +
1, n + 2, n + 3, n + 4, n + 5} can be partitioned into two sets such that the
product of the numbers in one set equals the product of the numbers in the
other set.

In the tetrahedron ABCD, angle BDC is a right angle. Suppose that the
foot H of the perpendicular from D to the plane ABC is the intersection of
the altitudes of ∆ABC. Prove that
(AB + BC + CA)2 ≤ 6(AD2 + BD2 + CD2 ).
For what tetrahedra does equality hold?

1970/6.
In a plane there are 100 points, no three of which are collinear. Consider all
possible triangles having these points as vertices. Prove that no more than
70% of these triangles are acute-angled.
