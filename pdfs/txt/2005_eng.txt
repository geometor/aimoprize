46rd IMO 2005

Problem 1. Six points are chosen on the sides of an equilateral triangle
ABC: A1 , A2 on BC, B1 , B2 on CA and C1 , C2 on AB, such that they are
the vertices of a convex hexagon A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 with equal side lengths.
Prove that the lines A1 B2 , B1 C2 and C1 A2 are concurrent.
Problem 2. Let a1 , a2 , . . . be a sequence of integers with infinitely many
positive and negative terms. Suppose that for every positive integer n the
numbers a1 , a2 , . . . , an leave n different remainders upon division by n.
Prove that every integer occurs exactly once in the sequence a1 , a2 , . . ..
Problem 3. Let x, y, z be three positive reals such that xyz ≥ 1. Prove
that
x5 − x2
y5 − y2
z5 − z2
+ 2
+ 2
≥ 0.

Problem 4. Determine all positive integers relatively prime to all the terms
of the infinite sequence
an = 2n + 3n + 6n − 1, n ≥ 1.
Problem 5. Let ABCD be a fixed convex quadrilateral with BC = DA
and BC not parallel with DA. Let two variable points E and F lie of the
sides BC and DA, respectively and satisfy BE = DF . The lines AC and
BD meet at P , the lines BD and EF meet at Q, the lines EF and AC meet
at R.
Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles P QR, as E and F vary, have a
common point other than P .
Problem 6. In a mathematical competition, in which 6 problems were
posed to the participants, every two of these problems were solved by more
than 25 of the contestants. Moreover, no contestant solved all the 6 problems.
Show that there are at least 2 contestants who solved exactly 5 problems
each.
