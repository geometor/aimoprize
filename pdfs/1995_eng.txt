1. Let A, B, C, D be four distinct points on a line, in that order. The
circles with diameters AC and BD intersect at X and Y . The line XY
meets BC at Z. Let P be a point on the line XY other than Z. The
line CP intersects the circle with diameter AC at C and M , and the
line BP intersects the circle with diameter BD at B and N . Prove
that the lines AM, DN, XY are concurrent.

2. Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon with AB = BC = CD and DE =
EF = F A, such that 6 BCD = 6 EF A = π/3. Suppose G and H are
points in the interior of the hexagon such that 6 AGB = 6 DHE =
2π/3. Prove that AG + GB + GH + DH + HE ≥ CF .
3. Let p be an odd prime number. How many p-element subsets A of
{1, 2, . . . 2p} are there, the sum of whose elements is divisible by p?
