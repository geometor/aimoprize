Let a1 , a2 , a3, · · · be an infinite increasing sequence of positive integers. Prove
that for every p ≥ 1 there are infinitely many am which can be written in
the form
am = xap + yaq
with x, y positive integers and q > p.

On the sides of an arbitrary triangle ABC, triangles ABR, BCP, CAQ are
constructed externally with 6 CBP = 6 CAQ = 45◦ , 6 BCP = 6 ACQ =
30◦ , 6 ABR = 6 BAR = 15◦ . Prove that 6 QRP = 90◦ and QR = RP.

When 44444444 is written in decimal notation, the sum of its digits is A. Let
B be the sum of the digits of A. Find the sum of the digits of B. (A and B
are written in decimal notation.)

Determine, with proof, whether or not one can find 1975 points on the circumference of a circle with unit radius such that the distance between any
two of them is a rational number.

1975/6.
Find all polynomials P, in two variables, with the following properties:
(i) for a positive integer n and all real t, x, y
P (tx, ty) = tn P (x, y)

(that is, P is homogeneous of degree n),
(ii) for all real a, b, c,
P (b + c, a) + P (c + a, b) + P (a + b, c) = 0,
(iii) P (1, 0) = 1.
