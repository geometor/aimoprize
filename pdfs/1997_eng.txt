1. In the plane the points with integer coordinates are the vertices of unit squares.
The squares are colored alternately black and white (as on a chessboard).
For any pair of positive integers m and n, consider a right-angled triangle whose
vertices have integer coordinates and whose legs, of lengths m and n, lie along
edges of the squares.
Let S1 be the total area of the black part of the triangle and S2 be the total
area of the white part. Let
f (m, n) = |S1 − S2 |.
(a) Calculate f (m, n) for all positive integers m and n which are either both
even or both odd.
(b) Prove that f (m, n) ≤ 21 max{m, n} for all m and n.
(c) Show that there is no constant C such that f (m, n) < C for all m and n.
2. The angle at A is the smallest angle of triangle ABC. The points B and C
divide the circumcircle of the triangle into two arcs. Let U be an interior point
of the arc between B and C which does not contain A. The perpendicular
bisectors of AB and AC meet the line AU at V and W , respectively. The lines
BV and CW meet at T . Show that
AU = T B + T C.
3. Let x1 , x2 , . . . , xn be real numbers satisfying the conditions
|x1 + x2 + · · · + xn | = 1
and

n+1
i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

Show that there exists a permutation y1 , y2 , . . . , yn of x1 , x2 , . . . , xn such that
|xi | ≤

|y1 + 2y2 + · · · + nyn | ≤

n+1

4. An n × n matrix whose entries come from the set S = {1, 2, . . . , 2n − 1} is
called a silver matrix if, for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n, the ith row and the ith column
together contain all elements of S. Show that
(a) there is no silver matrix for n = 1997;
(b) silver matrices exist for infinitely many values of n.
5. Find all pairs (a, b) of integers a, b ≥ 1 that satisfy the equation
2

ab = ba .
6. For each positive integer n , let f (n) denote the number of ways of representing
n as a sum of powers of 2 with nonnegative integer exponents. Representations
which differ only in the ordering of their summands are considered to be the
same. For instance, f (4) = 4, because the number 4 can be represented in the
following four ways:
4; 2 + 2; 2 + 1 + 1; 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.
Prove that, for any integer n ≥ 3,

2n /4 < f (2n ) < 2n /2 .
