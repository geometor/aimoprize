1961/1.
Solve the system of equations:
x+y+z = a
x + y 2 + z 2 = b2
xy = z 2
2

where a and b are constants. Give the conditions that a and b must satisfy
so that x, y, z (the solutions of the system) are distinct positive numbers.

Let a, b, c be the sides of a triangle, and T its area. Prove: a2 +b2 +c2 ≥ 4 3T.
In what case does equality hold?

1961/3.
Solve the equation cosn x − sinn x = 1, where n is a natural number.

1961/4.
Consider triangle P1 P2 P3 and a point P within the triangle. Lines P1 P, P2 P, P3 P
intersect the opposite sides in points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 respectively. Prove that, of
the numbers

P Q1 P Q2 P Q 3
at least one is ≤ 2 and at least one is ≥ 2.

1961/5.
Construct triangle ABC if AC = b, AB = c and 6 AM B = ω, where M is
the midpoint of segment BC and ω < 90◦ . Prove that a
solution exists if and only if
b tan

≤ c < b.

Consider a plane ε and three non-collinear points A, B, C on the same side of
ε; suppose the plane determined by these three points is not parallel to ε. In
plane a take three arbitrary points A0 , B 0 , C 0 . Let L, M, N be the midpoints
of segments AA0 , BB 0 , CC 0 ; let G be the centroid of triangle LM N. (We will
not consider positions of the points A0 , B 0 , C 0 such that the points L, M, N
do not form a triangle.) What is the locus of point G as A0 , B 0 , C 0 range
independently over the plane ε?
