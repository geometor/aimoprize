Problem 1. S is the set of all (h, k) with h, k non-negative integers such
that h + k < n. Each element of S is colored red or blue, so that if (h, k)
is red and h0 ≤ h, k 0 ≤ k, then (h0 , k 0 ) is also red. A type 1 subset of S has
n blue elements with different first member and a type 2 subset of S has n
blue elements with different second member. Show that there are the same
number of type 1 and type 2 subsets.
Problem 2. BC is a diameter of a circle center O. A is any point on
the circle with 6 AOC > 60o . EF is the chord which is the perpendicular
bisector of AO. D is the midpoint of the minor arc AB. The line through
O parallel to AD meets AC at J. Show that J is the incenter of triangle
CEF .
Problem 3. Find all pairs of integers m > 2, n > 2 such that there are
infinitely many positive integers k for which k n + k 2 − 1 divides k m + k − 1.
Problem 4. The positive divisors of the integer n > 1 are d1 < d2 < . . . <
dk , so that d1 = 1, dk = n. Let d = d1 d2 + d2 d3 + · · · + dk−1 dk . Show that
d < n2 and find all n for which d divides n2 .
Problem 5. Find all real-valued functions on the reals such that (f (x) +
f (y))((f (u) + f (v)) = f (xu − yv) + f (xv + yu) for all x, y, u, v.
Problem 6. n > 2 circles of radius 1 are drawn in the plane so that no line
meets more than two of the circles. Their centers are O1 , O2 , · · · , On . Show
P
that i<j 1/Oi Oj ≤ (n − 1)π/4.
