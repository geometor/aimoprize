given (a) A = 2, (b) A = 1, (c) A = 2, where only non-negative real
numbers are admitted for square roots?

1959/3.
Let a, b, c be real numbers. Consider the quadratic equation in cos x :
a cos2 x + b cos x + c = 0.
Using the numbers a, b, c, form a quadratic equation in cos 2x, whose roots
are the same as those of the original equation. Compare the equations in
cos x and cos 2x for a = 4, b = 2, c = −1.

1959/4.
Construct a right triangle with given hypotenuse c such that the median
drawn to the hypotenuse is the geometric mean of the two legs of the triangle.

1959/5.
An arbitrary point M is selected in the interior of the segment AB. The
squares AM CD and M BEF are constructed on the same side of AB, with
the segments AM and M B as their respective bases. The circles circumscribed about these squares, with centers P and Q, intersect at M and also
at another point N. Let N 0 denote the point of intersection of the straight
lines AF and BC.
(a) Prove that the points N and N 0 coincide.
(b) Prove that the straight lines M N pass through a fixed point S independent of the choice of M.
(c) Find the locus of the midpoints of the segments P Q as M varies between
A and B.

1959/6.
Two planes, P and Q, intersect along the line p. The point A is given in the
plane P, and the point C in the plane Q; neither of these points lies on the
straight line p. Construct an isosceles trapezoid ABCD (with AB parallel to
CD) in which a circle can be inscribed, and with vertices B and D lying in
the planes P and Q respectively.
