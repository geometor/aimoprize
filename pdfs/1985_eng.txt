Twenty-sixth International Olympiad, 1985
1985/1. A circle has center on the side AB of the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD.
The other three sides are tangent to the circle. Prove that AD + BC = AB.
1985/2. Let n and k be given relatively prime natural numbers, k < n. Each
number in the set M = {1, 2, ..., n − 1} is colored either blue or white. It is
given that
(i) for each i ∈ M, both i and n − i have the same color;
(ii) for each i ∈ M, i 6= k, both i and |i − k| have the same color. Prove that
all numbers in M must have the same color.
1985/3. For any polynomial P (x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + ak xk with integer
coefficients, the number of coefficients which are odd is denoted by w(P ).
For i = 0, 1, ..., let Qi (x) = (1 + x)i . Prove that if i1 i2 , ..., in are integers such
that 0 ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < in , then
w(Qi1 + Qi2 , + + Qin ) ≥ w(Qi1 ).
1985/4. Given a set M of 1985 distinct positive integers, none of which has
a prime divisor greater than 26. Prove that M contains at least one subset
of four distinct elements whose product is the fourth power of an integer.
1985/5. A circle with center O passes through the vertices A and C of triangle
ABC and intersects the segments AB and BC again at distinct points K and
N, respectively. The circumscribed circles of the triangles ABC and EBN
intersect at exactly two distinct points B and M. Prove that angle OM B is
a right angle.
1985/6. For every real number x1 , construct the sequence x1 , x2 , ... by setting
µ

xn+1 = xn xn +

¶

Prove that there exists exactly one value of x1 for which
0 < xn < xn+1 < 1
for every n.
