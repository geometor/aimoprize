1. Given a triangle ABC, let I be the center of its inscribed circle.
The internal bisectors of the angles A, B, C meet the opposite sides in
A0 , B 0 , C 0 respectively. Prove that

2. Let n > 6 be an integer and a1 , a2 , . . . , ak be all the natural numbers
less than n and relatively prime to n. If
a2 − a1 = a3 − a2 = · · · = ak − ak−1 > 0,
prove that n must be either a prime number or a power of 2.
3. Let S = {1, 2, 3, . . . , 280}. Find the smallest integer n such that each nelement subset of S contains five numbers which are pairwise relatively
prime.

1. Suppose G is a connected graph with k edges. Prove that it is possible to label the edges 1, 2, . . . , k in such a way that at each vertex
which belongs to two or more edges, the greatest common divisor of
the integers labeling those edges is equal to 1.
[A graph consists of a set of points, called vertices, together with a set
of edges joining certain pairs of distinct vertices. Each pair of vertices
u, v belongs to at most one edge. The graph G is connected if for
each pair of distinct vertices x, y there is some sequence of vertices
x = v0 , v1 , v2 , . . . , vm = y such that each pair vi , vi+1 (0 ≤ i < m) is
joined by an edge of G.]
2. Let ABC be a triangle and P an interior point of ABC . Show that
at least one of the angles 6 P AB, 6 P BC, 6 P CA is less than or equal
to 30◦ .

3. An infinite sequence x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . of real numbers is said to be bounded
if there is a constant C such that |xi | ≤ C for every i ≥ 0.
Given any real number a > 1, construct a bounded infinite sequence
x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . such that
|xi − xj ||i − j|a ≥ 1
for every pair of distinct nonnegative integers i, j.
