Nineteenth International Mathematical Olympiad,
1977
1977/1.
Equilateral triangles ABK, BCL, CDM, DAN are constructed inside the
square ABCD. Prove that the midpoints of the four segments KL, LM, M N, N K
and the midpoints of the eight segments AKBK, BL, CL, CM, DM, DN, AN
are the twelve vertices of a regular dodecagon.

1977/2.
In a finite sequence of real numbers the sum of any seven successive terms is
negative, and the sum of any eleven successive terms is positive. Determine
the maximum number of terms in the sequence.

1977/3.
Let n be a given integer > 2, and let Vn be the set of integers 1 + kn, where
k = 1, 2, .... A number m ∈ Vn is called indecomposable in Vn if there do not
exist numbers p, q ∈ Vn such that pq = m. Prove that there exists a number
r ∈ Vn that can be expressed as the product of elements indecomposable in
Vn in more than one way. (Products which differ only in the order of their
factors will be considered the same.)

1977/4.
Four real constants a, b, A, B are given, and
f (θ) = 1 − a cos θ − b sin θ − A cos 2θ − B sin 2θ.
Prove that if f (θ) ≥ 0 for all real θ, then
a2 + b2 ≤ 2 and A2 + B 2 ≤ 1.

1977/5.
Let a and b be positive integers. When a2 +b2 is divided by a+b, the quotient
is q and the remainder is r. Find all pairs (a, b) such that q 2 + r = 1977.

1977/6.
Let f (n) be a function defined on the set of all positive integers and having
all its values in the same set. Prove that if
f (n + 1) > f (f (n))
for each positive integer n, then
f (n) = n for each n.
