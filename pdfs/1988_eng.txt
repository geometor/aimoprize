1. Consider two coplanar circles of radii R and r (R > r) with the same center.
Let P be a fixed point on the smaller circle and B a variable point on the larger
circle. The line BP meets the larger circle again at C. The perpendicular l to
BP at P meets the smaller circle again at A. (If l is tangent to the circle at P
then A = P .)
(i) Find the set of values of BC 2 + CA2 + AB 2 .
(ii) Find the locus of the midpoint of BC.
2. Let n be a positive integer and let A1 , A2 , . . . , A2n+1 be subsets of a set B.
Suppose that
(a) Each Ai has exactly 2n elements,
(b) Each Ai ∩ Aj (1 ≤ i < j ≤ 2n + 1) contains exactly one element, and
(c) Every element of B belongs to at least two of the Ai .
For which values of n can one assign to every element of B one of the numbers
0 and 1 in such a way that Ai has 0 assigned to exactly n of its elements?
3. A function f is defined on the positive integers by

Determine the number of positive integers n, less than or equal to 1988, for
which f (n) = n.

is a union of disjoint intervals, the sum of whose lengths is 1988.
5. ABC is a triangle right-angled at A, and D is the foot of the altitude from A.
The straight line joining the incenters of the triangles ABD, ACD intersects
the sides AB, AC at the points K, L respectively. S and T denote the areas of
the triangles ABC and AKL respectively. Show that S ≥ 2T .
6. Let a and b be positive integers such that ab + 1 divides a2 + b2 . Show that
a2 + b2
ab + 1
is the square of an integer.
