Consider the system of equations
a11 x1 + a12 x2 + a13 x3 = 0
a21 x1 + a22 x2 + a23 x3 = 0
a31 x1 + a32 x2 + a33 x3 = 0

(a) a11 , a22 , a33 are positive numbers;
(b) the remaining coefficients are negative numbers;
(c) in each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.
Prove that the given system has only the solution x1 = x2 = x3 = 0.

1965/3.
Given the tetrahedron ABCD whose edges AB and CD have lengths a and
b respectively. The distance between the skew lines AB and CD is d, and
the angle between them is ω. Tetrahedron ABCD is divided into two solids
by plane ε, parallel to lines AB and CD. The ratio of the distances of ε from
AB and CD is equal to k. Compute the ratio of the volumes of the two solids
obtained.

1965/4.
Find all sets of four real numbers x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 such that the sum of any one
and the product of the other three is equal to 2.

1965/5.
Consider ∆OAB with acute angle AOB. Through a point M 6= O perpendiculars are drawn to OA and OB, the feet of which are P and Q respectively.
The point of intersection of the altitudes of ∆OP Q is H. What is the locus
of H if M is permitted to range over (a) the side AB, (b) the interior of
∆OAB?

1965/6.
In a plane a set of n points (n ≥ 3) is given. Each pair of points is connected
by a segment. Let d be the length of the longest of these segments. We define
a diameter of the set to be any connecting segment of length d. Prove that
the number of diameters of the given set is at most n.
