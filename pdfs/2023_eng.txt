Problem 1. Determine all composite integers n > 1 that satisfy the following property: if d1 , d2 , . . . , dk
are all the positive divisors of n with 1 = d1 < d2 < · · · < dk = n, then di divides di+1 + di+2 for
every 1 ⩽ i ⩽ k − 2.
Problem 2. Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with AB < AC. Let Ω be the circumcircle of
ABC. Let S be the midpoint of the arc CB of Ω containing A. The perpendicular from A to BC
meets BS at D and meets Ω again at E ̸= A. The line through D parallel to BC meets line BE
at L. Denote the circumcircle of triangle BDL by ω. Let ω meet Ω again at P ̸= B.
Prove that the line tangent to ω at P meets line BS on the internal angle bisector of ∠BAC.
Problem 3. For each integer k ⩾ 2, determine all infinite sequences of positive integers a1 , a2 , . . .
for which there exists a polynomial P of the form P (x) = xk + ck−1 xk−1 + · · · + c1 x + c0 , where
c0 , c1 , . . . , ck−1 are non-negative integers, such that
P (an ) = an+1 an+2 · · · an+k
for every integer n ⩾ 1.

is an integer for every n = 1, 2, . . . , 2023. Prove that a2023 ⩾ 3034.

Problem 5. Let n be a positive integer. A Japanese triangle consists of 1 + 2 + · · · + n circles
arranged in an equilateral triangular shape such that for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n, the ith row contains
exactly i circles, exactly one of which is coloured red. A ninja path in a Japanese triangle is a
sequence of n circles obtained by starting in the top row, then repeatedly going from a circle to one
of the two circles immediately below it and finishing in the bottom row. Here is an example of a
Japanese triangle with n = 6, along with a ninja path in that triangle containing two red circles.

n=6

In terms of n, find the greatest k such that in each Japanese triangle there is a ninja path containing
at least k red circles.

Problem 6. Let ABC be an equilateral triangle. Let A1 , B1 , C1 be interior points of ABC such
that BA1 = A1 C, CB1 = B1 A, AC1 = C1 B, and
∠BA1 C + ∠CB1 A + ∠AC1 B = 480◦ .
Let BC1 and CB1 meet at A2 , let CA1 and AC1 meet at B2 , and let AB1 and BA1 meet at C2 .
Prove that if triangle A1 B1 C1 is scalene, then the three circumcircles of triangles AA1 A2 , BB1 B2
and CC1 C2 all pass through two common points.
(Note: a scalene triangle is one where no two sides have equal length.)
