Sixteenth International Olympiad, 1974
1974/1.
Three players A, B and C play the following game: On each of three cards
an integer is written. These three numbers p, q, r satisfy 0 < p < q < r. The
three cards are shuffled and one is dealt to each player. Each then receives
the number of counters indicated by the card he holds. Then the cards are
shuffled again; the counters remain with the players.
This process (shuffling, dealing, giving out counters) takes place for at least
two rounds. After the last round, A has 20 counters in all, B has 10 and C
has 9. At the last round B received r counters. Who received q counters on
the first round?

Consider decompositions of an 8 × 8 chessboard into p non-overlapping rectangles subject to the following conditions:
(i) Each rectangle has as many white squares as black squares.
(ii) If ai is the number of white squares in the i-th rectangle, then a1 < a2 <
· · · < ap . Find the maximum value of p for which such a decomposition is
possible. For this value of p, determine all possible sequences a1 , a2 , · · · , ap .

Let P be a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients. If n(P ) is
the number of distinct integers k such that (P (k))2 = 1, prove that n(P ) −
deg(P ) ≤ 2, where deg(P ) denotes the degree of the polynomial P.
