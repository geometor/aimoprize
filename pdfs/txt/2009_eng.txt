Problem 1. Let n be a positive integer and let a1 , . . . , ak (k ≥ 2) be distinct integers in the set
{1, . . . , n} such that n divides ai (ai+1 −1) for i = 1, . . . , k −1. Prove that n does not divide ak (a1 −1).
Problem 2. Let ABC be a triangle with circumcentre O. The points P and Q are interior points
of the sides CA and AB, respectively. Let K, L and M be the midpoints of the segments BP , CQ
and P Q, respectively, and let Γ be the circle passing through K, L and M . Suppose that the line
P Q is tangent to the circle Γ. Prove that OP = OQ.
Problem 3. Suppose that s1 , s2 , s3 , . . . is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers such
that the subsequences
ss1 , ss2 , ss3 , . . .

and

ss1 +1 , ss2 +1 , ss3 +1 , . . .

are both arithmetic progressions. Prove that the sequence s1 , s2 , s3 , . . . is itself an arithmetic progression.

Problem 4. Let ABC be a triangle with AB = AC. The angle bisectors of 6 CAB and 6 ABC
meet the sides BC and CA at D and E, respectively. Let K be the incentre of triangle ADC.
Suppose that 6 BEK = 45◦ . Find all possible values of 6 CAB.
Problem 5. Determine all functions f from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers
such that, for all positive integers a and b, there exists a non-degenerate triangle with sides of lengths
a, f (b) and f (b + f (a) − 1).
(A triangle is non-degenerate if its vertices are not collinear.)
Problem 6. Let a1 , a2 , . . . , an be distinct positive integers and let M be a set of n − 1 positive
integers not containing s = a1 + a2 + · · · + an . A grasshopper is to jump along the real axis, starting
at the point 0 and making n jumps to the right with lengths a1 , a2 , . . . , an in some order. Prove that
the order can be chosen in such a way that the grasshopper never lands on any point in M .
