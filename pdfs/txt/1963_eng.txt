x2 − p + 2 x2 − 1 = x,

where p is a real parameter.

Point A and segment BC are given. Determine the locus of points in space
which are vertices of right angles with one side passing through A, and the
other side intersecting the segment BC.

1963/3.
In an n-gon all of whose interior angles are equal, the lengths of consecutive
sides satisfy the relation
a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an .
Prove that a1 = a2 = · · · = an .

Five students, A, B, C, D, E, took part in a contest. One prediction was that
the contestants would finish in the order ABCDE. This prediction was very
poor. In fact no contestant finished in the position predicted, and no two
contestants predicted to finish consecutively actually did so. A second prediction had the contestants finishing in the order DAECB. This prediction
was better. Exactly two of the contestants finished in the places predicted,
and two disjoint pairs of students predicted to finish consecutively actually
did so. Determine the order in which the contestants finished.
