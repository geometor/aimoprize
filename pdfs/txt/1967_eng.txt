Let ABCD be a parallelogram with side lengths AB = a, AD = 1, and with
BAD = α. If ∆ABD is acute, prove that the four circles of radius 1 with
centers A, B, C, D cover the parallelogram if and only if
√
a ≤ cos α + 3 sin α.

1967/2.
Prove that if one and only one edge of a tetrahedron is greater than 1, then
its volume is ≤ 1/8.

1967/3.
Let k, m, n be natural numbers such that m + k + 1 is a prime greater than
n + 1. Let cs = s(s + 1). Prove that the product
(cm+1 − ck )(cm+2 − ck ) · · · (cm+n − ck )
is divisible by the product c1 c2 · · · cn .

1967/4.
Let A0 B0 C0 and A1 B1 C1 be any two acute-angled triangles. Consider all
triangles ABC that are similar to ∆A1 B1 C1 (so that vertices A1 , B1 , C1 correspond to vertices A, B, C, respectively) and circumscribed about triangle
A0 B0 C0 (where A0 lies on BC, B0 on CA, and AC0 on AB). Of all such
possible triangles, determine the one with maximum area, and construct it.

1967/5.
Consider the sequence {cn }, where
c1 = a1 + a2 + · · · + a8
c2 = a21 + a22 + · · · + a28
···
cn = an1 + an2 + · · · + an8
···
in which a1 , a2 , · · · , a8 are real numbers not all equal to zero. Suppose that
an infinite number of terms of the sequence {cn } are equal to zero. Find all
natural numbers n for which cn = 0.

1967/6.
In a sports contest, there were m medals awarded on n successive days (n >
1). On the first day, one medal and 1/7 of the remaining m − 1 medals
were awarded. On the second day, two medals and 1/7 of the now remaining
medals were awarded; and so on. On the n-th and last day, the remaining n
medals were awarded. How many days did the contest last, and how many
medals were awarded altogether?
