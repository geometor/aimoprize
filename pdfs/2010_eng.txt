holds for all x, y ∈ R. (Here bzc denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to z.)
Problem 2. Let I be the incentre of triangle ABC and let Γ be its circumcircle. Let the line AI

Problem 4. Let P be a point inside the triangle ABC. The lines AP , BP and CP intersect the
circumcircle Γ of triangle ABC again at the points K, L and M respectively. The tangent to Γ at C
intersects the line AB at S. Suppose that SC = SP . Prove that M K = M L.
Problem 5. In each of six boxes B1 , B2 , B3 , B4 , B5 , B6 there is initially one coin. There are two
types of operation allowed:
Type 1: Choose a nonempty box Bj with 1 ≤ j ≤ 5. Remove one coin from Bj and add two
coins to Bj+1 .
Type 2: Choose a nonempty box Bk with 1 ≤ k ≤ 4. Remove one coin from Bk and exchange
the contents of (possibly empty) boxes Bk+1 and Bk+2 .
Determine whether there is a finite sequence of such operations that results in boxes B1 , B2 , B3 , B4 , B5

being empty and box B6 containing exactly 20102010
coins. (Note that ab = a(b ) .)
Problem 6. Let a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . be a sequence of positive real numbers. Suppose that for some
positive integer s, we have
an = max{ak + an−k | 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1}
for all n > s. Prove that there exist positive integers ` and N , with ` ≤ s and such that an = a` +an−`
for all n ≥ N .
