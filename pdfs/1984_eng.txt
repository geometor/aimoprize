Twenty-fifth International Olympiad, 1984
1984/1. Prove that 0 ≤ yz + zx + xy − 2xyz ≤ 7/27, where x, y and z are
non-negative real numbers for which x + y + z = 1.
1984/2. Find one pair of positive integers a and b such that:
(i) ab(a + b) is not divisible by 7;
(ii) (a + b)7 − a7 − b7 is divisible by 77 .
Justify your answer.
1984/3. In the plane two different points O and A are given. For each
point X of the plane, other than O, denote by a(X) the measure of the angle
between OA and OX in radians, counterclockwise from OA(0 ≤ a(X) < 2π).
Let C(X) be the circle with center O and radius of length OX + a(X)/OX.
Each point of the plane is colored by one of a finite number of colors. Prove
that there exists a point Y for which a(Y ) > 0 such that its color appears
on the circumference of the circle C(Y ).
1984/4. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral such that the line CD is a
tangent to the circle on AB as diameter. Prove that the line AB is a tangent
to the circle on CD as diameter if and only if the lines BC and AD are
parallel.
1984/5. Let d be the sum of the lengths of all the diagonals of a plane convex
polygon with n vertices (n > 3), and let p be its perimeter. Prove that

where [x] denotes the greatest integer not exceeding x.
1984/6. Let a, b, c and d be odd integers such that 0 < a < b < c < d and
ad = bc. Prove that if a + d = 2k and b + c = 2m for some integers k and m,
then a = 1.
