Problem 1. Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with AB 6= AC. The
circle with diameter BC intersects the sides AB and AC at M and N
respectively. Denote by O the midpoint of the side BC. The bisectors of
the angles 6 BAC and 6 M ON intersect at R. Prove that the circumcircles
of the triangles BM R and CN R have a common point lying on the side
BC.
Problem 2. Find all polynomials f with real coefficients such that for all
reals a,b,c such that ab + bc + ca = 0 we have the following relations
f (a − b) + f (b − c) + f (c − a) = 2f (a + b + c).
Problem 3. Define a ”hook” to be a figure made up of six unit squares
as shown below in the picture, or any of the figures obtained by applying
rotations and reflections to this figure.

Determine all m×n rectangles that can be covered without gaps and without
overlaps with hooks such that
• the rectangle is covered without gaps and without overlaps
• no part of a hook covers area outside the rectagle.
Problem 4. Let n ≥ 3 be an integer. Let t1 , t2 , ..., tn be positive real
numbers such that

Show that ti , tj , tk are side lengths of a triangle for all i, j, k with
1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n.
Problem 5. In a convex quadrilateral ABCD the diagonal BD does not
bisect the angles ABC and CDA. The point P lies inside ABCD and
satisfies
6 P BC = 6 DBA and 6 P DC = 6 BDA.
Prove that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if AP = CP .

Problem 6. We call a positive integer alternating if every two consecutive
digits in its decimal representation are of different parity.
Find all positive integers n such that n has a multiple which is alternating.
