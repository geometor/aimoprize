1968/1.
Prove that there is one and only one triangle whose side lengths are consecutive integers, and one of whose angles is twice as large as another.

1968/2.
Find all natural numbers x such that the product of their digits (in decimal
notation) is equal to x2 − 10x − 22.

1968/3.
Consider the system of equations
ax21 + bx1 + c = x2
ax22 + bx2 + c = x3
···
2
axn−1 + bxn−1 + c = xn
ax2n + bxn + c = x1 ,
with unknowns x1 , x2 , · · · , xn , where a, b, c are real and a 6= 0. Let ∆ =
(b − 1)2 − 4ac. Prove that for this system
(a) if ∆ < 0, there is no solution,
(b) if ∆ = 0, there is exactly one solution,
(c) if ∆ > 0, there is more than one solution.

1968/4.
Prove that in every tetrahedron there is a vertex such that the three edges
meeting there have lengths which are the sides of a triangle.

1968/5.
Let f be a real-valued function defined for all real numbers x such that, for
some positive constant a, the equation
1 q
f (x + a) = + f (x) − [f (x)]2
2
holds for all x.
(a) Prove that the function f is periodic (i.e., there exists a positive number
b such that f (x + b) = f (x) for all x).
(b) For a = 1, give an example of a non-constant function with the required
properties.
