Twentieth International Olympiad, 1978
1978/1. m and n are natural numbers with 1 ≤ m < n. In their decimal
representations, the last three digits of 1978m are equal, respectively, to the
last three digits of 1978n . Find m and n such that m + n has its least value.
1978/2. P is a given point inside a given sphere. Three mutually perpendicular rays from P intersect the sphere at points U, V, and W ; Q denotes the
vertex diagonally opposite to P in the parallelepiped determined by P U, P V,
and P W. Find the locus of Q for all such triads of rays from P
1978/3. The set of all positive integers is the union of two disjoint subsets
{f (1), f (2), ..., f (n), ...}, {g(1), g(2), ..., g(n), ...}, where
f (1) < f (2) < · · · < f (n) < · · · ,
g(1) < g(2) < · · · < g(n) < · · · ,
and
g(n) = f (f (n)) + 1for all n ≥ 1.
Determine f (240).
1978/4. In triangle ABC, AB = AC. A circle is tangent internally to the
circumcircle of triangle ABC and also to sides AB, AC at P, Q, respectively.
Prove that the midpoint of segment P Q is the center of the incircle of triangle
ABC.
1978/5. Let {ak }(k = 1, 2, 3, ..., n, ...) be a sequence of distinct positive
integers. Prove that for all natural numbers n,

1978/6. An international society has its members from six different countries.
The list of members contains 1978 names, numbered 1, 2, ..., 1978. Prove that
there is at least one member whose number is the sum of the numbers of two
members from his own country, or twice as large as the number of one member
from his own country.
