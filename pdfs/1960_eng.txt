1960/1.
Determine all three-digit numbers N having the property that N is divisible
by 11, and N/11 is equal to the sum of the squares of the digits of N.

1960/2.
For what values of the variable x does the following inequality hold:
4x2
√
< 2x + 9?
(1 − 1 + 2x)2

1960/3.
In a given right triangle ABC, the hypotenuse BC, of length a, is divided
into n equal parts (n an odd integer). Let α be the acute angle subtending,
from A, that segment which contains the midpoint of the hypotenuse. Let h
be the length of the altitude to the hypotenuse of the triangle. Prove:
4nh
tan α = 2
.
(n − 1)a

1960/4.
Construct triangle ABC, given ha , hb (the altitudes from A and B) and ma ,
the median from vertex A.

1960/5.
Consider the cube ABCDA0 B 0 C 0 D0 (with face ABCD directly above face
A0 B 0 C 0 D0 ).
(a) Find the locus of the midpoints of segments XY, where X is any point
of AC and Y is any point of B 0 D0 .
(b) Find the locus of points Z which lie on the segments XY of part (a) with
ZY = 2XZ.

1960/6.
Consider a cone of revolution with an inscribed sphere tangent to the base
of the cone. A cylinder is circumscribed about this sphere so
that one of its bases lies in the base of the cone. Let V1 be the volume of the
cone and V2 the volume of the cylinder.
(a) Prove that V1 6= V2 .
(b) Find the smallest number k for which V1 = kV2 , for this case, construct
the angle subtended by a diameter of the base of the cone at the vertex of
the cone.

1960/7.
An isosceles trapezoid with bases a and c and altitude h is given.
(a) On the axis of symmetry of this trapezoid, find all points P such that
both legs of the trapezoid subtend right angles at P.
(b) Calculate the distance of P from either base.
(c) Determine under what conditions such points P actually exist. (Discuss
various cases that might arise.)
