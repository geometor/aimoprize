1. Find all integers a, b, c with 1 < a < b < c such that
(a − 1)(b − 1)(c − 1)

is a divisor of abc − 1.

2. Let R denote the set of all real numbers. Find all functions f : R → R
such that
³

´

f x2 + f (y) = y + (f (x))2

for all x, y ∈ R.

3. Consider nine points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair
of points is joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is
either colored blue or red or left uncolored. Find the smallest value of
n such that whenever exactly n edges are colored, the set of colored
edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same
color.

1. In the plane let C be a circle, L a line tangent to the circle C, and
M a point on L. Find the locus of all points P with the following
property: there exists two points Q, R on L such that M is the
midpoint of QR and C is the inscribed circle of triangle P QR.
2. Let S be a finite set of points in three-dimensional space. Let Sx , Sy , Sz
be the sets consisting of the orthogonal projections of the points of S
onto the yz-plane, zx-plane, xy-plane, respectively. Prove that
|S|2 ≤ |Sx | · |Sy | · |Sz |,
where |A| denotes the number of elements in the finite set |A|. (Note:
The orthogonal projection of a point onto a plane is the foot of the
perpendicular from that point to the plane.)

3. For each positive integer n, S(n) is defined to be the greatest integer
such that, for every positive integer k ≤ S(n), n2 can be written as
the sum of k positive squares.
(a) Prove that S(n) ≤ n2 − 14 for each n ≥ 4.
(b) Find an integer n such that S(n) = n2 − 14.
(c) Prove that there are infintely many integers n such that S(n) =
n2 − 14.
