1. Let pn (k) be the number of permutations of the set {1, . . . , n}, n ≥ 1, which
have exactly k fixed points. Prove that
n
X

k · pn (k) = n!.

k=0

(Remark: A permutation f of a set S is a one-to-one mapping of S onto itself.
An element i in S is called a fixed point of the permutation f if f (i) = i.)
2. In an acute-angled triangle ABC the interior bisector of the angle A intersects
BC at L and intersects the circumcircle of ABC again at N . From point L
perpendiculars are drawn to AB and AC, the feet of these perpendiculars being
K and M respectively. Prove that the quadrilateral AKN M and the triangle
ABC have equal areas.
3. Let x1 , x2 , . . . , xn be real numbers satisfying x21 + x22 + · · · + x2n = 1. Prove that
for every integer k ≥ 2 there are integers a1 , a2 , . . . , an , not all 0, such that
|ai | ≤ k − 1 for all i and
√
(k − 1) n
.
|a1 x1 + a1 x2 + · · · + an xn | ≤
kn − 1

4. Prove that there is no function f from the set of non-negative integers into itself
such that f (f (n)) = n + 1987 for every n.
5. Let n be an integer greater than or equal to 3. Prove that there is a set of n
points in the plane such that the distance between any two points is irrational
and each set of three points determines a non-degenerate triangle with rational
area.

6. Let n be an integer greater than or equal
p to 2. Prove 2that if k + k + n is prime
for all integers k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n/3, then k + k + n is prime for all
integers k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 2.
