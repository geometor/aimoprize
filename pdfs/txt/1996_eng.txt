1. We are given a positive integer r and a rectangular board ABCD with
dimensions |AB| = 20, |BC| = 12. The rectangle is divided into a grid
of 20 × 12 unit squares. The following moves are permitted on the
board: one can move from one square to another
only if the distance
√
between the centers of the two squares is r. The task is to find a
sequence of moves leading from the square with A as a vertex to the
square with B as a vertex.
(a) Show that the task cannot be done if r is divisible by 2 or 3.
(b) Prove that the task is possible when r = 73.
(c) Can the task be done when r = 97?
2. Let P be a point inside triangle ABC such that
6

AP B − 6 ACB = 6 AP C − 6 ABC.

Let D, E be the incenters of triangles AP B, AP C, respectively. Show
that AP, BD, CE meet at a point.
3. Let S denote the set of nonnegative integers. Find all functions f from
S to itself such that
f (m + f (n)) = f (f (m)) + f (n)

∀m, n ∈ S.

1. The positive integers a and b are such that the numbers 15a + 16b
and 16a − 15b are both squares of positive integers. What is the least
possible value that can be taken on by the smaller of these two squares?
2. Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon such that AB is parallel to DE,
BC is parallel to EF , and CD is parallel to F A. Let RA , RC , RE denote
the circumradii of triangles F AB, BCD, DEF , respectively, and let P
denote the perimeter of the hexagon. Prove that
RA + RC + RE ≥

P
.

3. Let p, q, n be three positive integers with p + q < n. Let (x0 , x1 , . . . , xn )
be an (n + 1)-tuple of integers satisfying the following conditions:
(a) x0 = xn = 0.
(b) For each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ n, either xi − xi−1 = p or xi − xi−1 = −q.
Show that there exist indices i < j with (i, j) 6= (0, n), such that
xi = xj .
