1. Determine all finite sets S of at least three points in the plane which satisfy the
following condition:
for any two distinct points A and B in S, the perpendicular bisector
of the line segment AB is an axis of symmetry for S.
2. Let n be a fixed integer, with n ≥ 2.
(a) Determine the least constant C such that the inequality
X

Ã
xi xj (x2i + x2j ) ≤ C

1≤i<j≤n

X

!4
xi

1≤i≤n

holds for all real numbers x1 , · · · , xn ≥ 0.
(b) For this constant C, determine when equality holds.
3. Consider an n × n square board, where n is a fixed even positive integer. The
board is divided into n2 unit squares. We say that two different squares on the
board are adjacent if they have a common side.
N unit squares on the board are marked in such a way that every square (marked
or unmarked) on the board is adjacent to at least one marked square.
Determine the smallest possible value of N .

4. Determine all pairs (n, p) of positive integers such that
p is a prime,
n not exceeded 2p, and
(p − 1)n + 1 is divisible by np−1 .
5. Two circles G1 and G2 are contained inside the circle G, and are tangent to G
at the distinct points M and N , respectively. G1 passes through the center of
G2 . The line passing through the two points of intersection of G1 and G2 meets
G at A and B. The lines M A and M B meet G1 at C and D, respectively.
Prove that CD is tangent to G2 .
6. Determine all functions f : R −→ R such that
f (x − f (y)) = f (f (y)) + xf (y) + f (x) − 1
for all real numbers x, y.
