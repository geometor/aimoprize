Prove that p is divisible by 1979.
1979/2. A prism with pentagons A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 and B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 as top and
bottom faces is given. Each side of the two pentagons and each of the linesegments Ai Bj for all i, j = 1, ..., 5, is colored either red or green. Every
triangle whose vertices are vertices of the prism and whose sides have all
been colored has two sides of a different color. Show that all 10 sides of the
top and bottom faces are the same color.
1979/3. Two circles in a plane intersect. Let A be one of the points of
intersection. Starting simultaneously from A two points move with constant
speeds, each point travelling along its own circle in the same sense. The two
points return to A simultaneously after one revolution. Prove that there is
a fixed point P in the plane such that, at any time, the distances from P to
the moving points are equal.
1979/4. Given a plane π, a point P in this plane and a point Q not in π,
find all points R in π such that the ratio (QP + P A)/QR is a maximum.
1979/5. Find all real numbers a for which there exist non-negative real
numbers x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 satisfying the relations

1979/6. Let A and E be opposite vertices of a regular octagon. A frog starts
jumping at vertex A. From any vertex of the octagon except E, it may jump
to either of the two adjacent vertices. When it reaches vertex E, the frog
stops and stays there.. Let an be the number of distinct paths of exactly n
jumps ending at E. Prove that a2n−1 = 0,

where x = 2 + 2 and y = 2 − 2.
Note. A path of n jumps is a sequence of vertices (P0 , ..., Pn ) such that
(i) P0 = A, Pn = E;
(ii) for every i, 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, Pi is distinct from E;
(iii) for every i, 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, Pi and Pi+1 are adjacent.
