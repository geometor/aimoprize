Let a0 < a1 < a2 < Â· Â· Â· be an innite sequence of positive integers. Prove that there
exists a unique integer n â‰¥ 1 such that

Problem 1.

an <

a0 + a1 + Â· Â· Â· + an
â‰¤ an+1 .
n

Let n â‰¥ 2 be an integer. Consider an n Ã— n chessboard consisting of n2 unit squares.
A conguration of n rooks on this board is peaceful if every row and every column contains exactly
one rook. Find the greatest positive integer k such that, for each peaceful conguration of n rooks,
there is a k Ã— k square which does not contain a rook on any of its k 2 unit squares.
Problem 2.

Convex quadrilateral ABCD has âˆ ABC = âˆ CDA = 90â—¦ . Point H is the foot of the
perpendicular from A to BD. Points S and T lie on sides AB and AD, respectively, such that H
lies inside triangle SCT and

Points P and Q lie on side BC of acute-angled triangle ABC so that âˆ P AB = âˆ BCA
and âˆ CAQ = âˆ ABC . Points M and N lie on lines AP and AQ, respectively, such that P is the
midpoint of AM , and Q is the midpoint of AN . Prove that lines BM and CN intersect on the
circumcircle of triangle ABC .
Problem 4.

For each positive integer n, the Bank of Cape Town issues coins of denomination n1 .
Given a nite collection of such coins (of not necessarily dierent denominations) with total value at
most 99 + 21 , prove that it is possible to split this collection into 100 or fewer groups, such that each
group has total value at most 1.
Problem 5.

A set of lines in the plane is in general position if no two are parallel and no three
pass through the same point. A set of lines in general position cuts the plane into regions, some of
which have nite area; we call these its nite regions. Prove thatâˆšfor all suciently large n, in any
set of n lines in general position it is possible to colour at least n of the lines blue in such a way
that none of its nite regions has a completely blue boundary.
