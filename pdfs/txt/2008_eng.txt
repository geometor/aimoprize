Problem 1. An acute-angled triangle ABC has orthocentre H. The circle passing through H with
centre the midpoint of BC intersects the line BC at A1 and A2 . Similarly, the circle passing through
H with centre the midpoint of CA intersects the line CA at B1 and B2 , and the circle passing through
H with centre the midpoint of AB intersects the line AB at C1 and C2 . Show that A1 , A2 , B1 , B2 ,
C1 , C2 lie on a circle.

Problem 4. Find all functions f : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) (so, f is a function from the positive real
numbers to the positive real numbers) such that

f (w)

f (y 2 ) + f (z 2 )

2

=

w 2 + x2
y2 + z2

for all positive real numbers w, x, y, z, satisfying wx = yz.
Problem 5. Let n and k be positive integers with k ≥ n and k − n an even number. Let 2n lamps
labelled 1, 2, . . . , 2n be given, each of which can be either on or off. Initially all the lamps are off.
We consider sequences of steps: at each step one of the lamps is switched (from on to off or from off
to on).
Let N be the number of such sequences consisting of k steps and resulting in the state where
lamps 1 through n are all on, and lamps n + 1 through 2n are all off.
Let M be the number of such sequences consisting of k steps, resulting in the state where lamps
1 through n are all on, and lamps n + 1 through 2n are all off, but where none of the lamps n + 1
through 2n is ever switched on.
Determine the ratio N/M .
Problem 6. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with |BA| 6= |BC|. Denote the incircles of
triangles ABC and ADC by ω1 and ω2 respectively. Suppose that there exists a circle ω tangent to
the ray BA beyond A and to the ray BC beyond C, which is also tangent to the lines AD and CD.
Prove that the common external tangents of ω1 and ω2 intersect on ω.
