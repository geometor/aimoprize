Determine whether or not there exists a finite set M of points in space not
lying in the same plane such that, for any two points A and B of M, one can
select two other points C and D of M so that lines AB and CD are parallel
and not coincident.

Let a and b be real numbers for which the equation
x4 + ax3 + bx2 + ax + 1 = 0
has at least one real solution. For all such pairs (a, b), find the minimum
value of a2 + b2 .

A soldier needs to check on the presence of mines in a region having the
shape of an equilateral triangle. The radius of action of his detector is equal
to half the altitude of the triangle. The soldier leaves from one vertex of the
triangle. What path shouid he follow in order to travel the least possible
distance and still accomplish his mission?

1973/5.
G is a set of non-constant functions of the real variable x of the form
f (x) = ax + b, a and b are real numbers,
and G has the following properties:
(a) If f and g are in G, then g ◦ f is in G; here (g ◦ f )(x) = g[f (x)].
(b) If f is in G, then its inverse f −1 is in G; here the inverse of f (x) = ax + b
is f −1 (x) = (x − b)/a.
(c) For every f in G, there exists a real number xf such that f (xf ) = xf .
Prove that there exists a real number k such that f (k) = k for all f in G.
