1981/1. P is a point inside a given triangle ABC.D, E, F are the feet of the
perpendiculars from P to the lines BC, CA, AB respectively. Find all P for
which

is least.
1981/2. Let 1 ≤ r ≤ n and consider all subsets of r elements of the set
{1, 2, ..., n}. Each of these subsets has a smallest member. Let F (n, r) denote
the arithmetic mean of these smallest numbers; prove that
F (n, r) =

n+1
.
r+1

1981/3. Determine the maximum value of m3 +n3 ,where m and n are integers
satisfying m, n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 1981} and (n2 − mn − m2 )2 = 1.
1981/4. (a) For which values of n > 2 is there a set of n consecutive positive
integers such that the largest number in the set is a divisor of the least
common multiple of the remaining n − 1 numbers?
(b) For which values of n > 2 is there exactly one set having the stated
property?
1981/5. Three congruent circles have a common point O and lie inside a
given triangle. Each circle touches a pair of sides of the triangle. Prove
that the incenter and the circumcenter of the triangle and the point O are
collinear.
1981/6. The function f (x, y) satisfies
(1) f (0, y) = y + 1,
(2)f (x + 1, 0) = f (x, 1),
(3) f (x + 1, y + 1) = f (x, f (x + 1, y)),
for all non-negative integers x, y. Determine f (4, 1981).
