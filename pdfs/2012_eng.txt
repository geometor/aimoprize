Problem 1. Given triangle ABC the point J is the centre of the excircle opposite the vertex A.
This excircle is tangent to the side BC at M , and to the lines AB and AC at K and L, respectively.
The lines LM and BJ meet at F , and the lines KM and CJ meet at G. Let S be the point of
intersection of the lines AF and BC, and let T be the point of intersection of the lines AG and BC.
Prove that M is the midpoint of ST .
(The excircle of ABC opposite the vertex A is the circle that is tangent to the line segment BC,
to the ray AB beyond B, and to the ray AC beyond C.)
Problem 2. Let n ≥ 3 be an integer, and let a2 , a3 , . . . , an be positive real numbers such that
a2 a3 · · · an = 1. Prove that
(1 + a2 )2 (1 + a3 )3 · · · (1 + an )n > nn .
Problem 3. The liar’s guessing game is a game played between two players A and B. The rules
of the game depend on two positive integers k and n which are known to both players.
At the start of the game A chooses integers x and N with 1 ≤ x ≤ N . Player A keeps x secret,
and truthfully tells N to player B. Player B now tries to obtain information about x by asking player
A questions as follows: each question consists of B specifying an arbitrary set S of positive integers
(possibly one specified in some previous question), and asking A whether x belongs to S. Player
B may ask as many such questions as he wishes. After each question, player A must immediately
answer it with yes or no, but is allowed to lie as many times as she wants; the only restriction is
that, among any k + 1 consecutive answers, at least one answer must be truthful.
After B has asked as many questions as he wants, he must specify a set X of at most n positive
integers. If x belongs to X, then B wins; otherwise, he loses. Prove that:
1. If n ≥ 2k , then B can guarantee a win.
2. For all sufficiently large k, there exists an integer n ≥ 1.99k such that B cannot guarantee a
win.

Problem 4.

Find all functions f : Z → Z such that, for all integers a, b, c that satisfy a + b + c = 0,

the following equality holds:

f (a)2 + f (b)2 + f (c)2 = 2f (a)f (b) + 2f (b)f (c) + 2f (c)f (a).
(Here Z denotes the set of integers.)
Problem 5.

Let ABC be a triangle with ∠BCA = 90◦ , and let D be the foot of the altitude from

C . Let X be a point in the interior of the segment CD. Let K be the point on the segment AX
such that BK = BC . Similarly, let L be the point on the segment BX such that AL = AC . Let M
be the point of intersection of AL and BK .
Show that M K = M L.
