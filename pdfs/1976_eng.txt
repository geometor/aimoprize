1976/1.
In a plane convex quadrilateral of area 32, the sum of the lengths of two
opposite sides and one diagonal is 16. Determine all possible lengths of the
other diagonal.

1976/2.
Let P1 (x) = x2 − 2 and Pj (x) = P1 (Pj−1 (x)) for j = 2, 3, · · ·. Show that,
for any positive integer n, the roots of the equation Pn (x) = x are real and
distinct.

1976/3.
A rectangular box can be filled completely with unit cubes. If one places as
many cubes as possible, each with volume 2, in the box, so that their edges
are parallel to the edges of the box, one can fill exactly 40% of the box.
Determine the possible dimensions of all such boxes.

1976/4.
Determine, with proof, the largest number which is the product of positive
integers whose sum is 1976.

1976/5.
Consider the system of p equations in q = 2p unknowns x1 , x2 , · · · , xq :
a11 x1 + a12 x2 + · · · + a1q xq = 0
a21 x1 + a22 x2 + · · · + a2q xq = 0
···
ap1 x1 + ap2 x2 + · · · + apq xq = 0
with every coefficient aij member of the set {−1, 0, 1}. Prove that the system
has a solution (x1 , x2 , · · · , xq ) such that
(a) all xj (j = 1, 2, ..., q) are integers,
(b) there is at least one value of j for which xj 6= 0,
(c) |xj | ≤ q(j = 1, 2, ..., q).

1976/6.
A sequence {un } is defined by
u0 = 2, u1 = 5/2, un+1 = un (u2n−1 − 2) − u1 for n = 1, 2, · · ·

Prove that for positive integers n,
n

[un ] = 2[2 −(−1) ]/3
where [x] denotes the greatest integer ≤ x.
