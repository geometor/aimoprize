Problem 1. Real numbers a1 , a2 , . . . , an are given. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) define
di = max{aj : 1 ≤ j ≤ i} − min{aj : i ≤ j ≤ n}
and let
d = max{di : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.
(a) Prove that, for any real numbers x1 ≤ x2 ≤ · · · ≤ xn ,
d
max{|xi − ai | : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} ≥ .

(b) Show that there are real numbers x1 ≤ x2 ≤ · · · ≤ xn such that equality holds
in (∗).
Problem 2. Consider five points A, B, C, D and E such that ABCD is a parallelogram
and BCED is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let ` be a line passing through A. Suppose that
` intersects the interior of the segment DC at F and intersects line BC at G. Suppose
also that EF = EG = EC. Prove that ` is the bisector of angle DAB.
Problem 3. In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends. Friendship
is always mutual. Call a group of competitors a clique if each two of them are friends. (In
particular, any group of fewer than two competitors is a clique.) The number of members
of a clique is called its size.
Given that, in this competition, the largest size of a clique is even, prove that the
competitors can be arranged in two rooms such that the largest size of a clique contained
in one room is the same as the largest size of a clique contained in the other room.

Problem 4. In triangle ABC the bisector of angle BCA intersects the circumcircle
again at R, the perpendicular bisector of BC at P , and the perpendicular bisector of AC
at Q. The midpoint of BC is K and the midpoint of AC is L. Prove that the triangles
RP K and RQL have the same area.
Problem 5. Let a and b be positive integers. Show that if 4ab − 1 divides (4a2 − 1)2 ,
then a = b.
Problem 6. Let n be a positive integer. Consider
S = {(x, y, z) : x, y, z ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n}, x + y + z > 0}
as a set of (n + 1)3 − 1 points in three-dimensional space. Determine the smallest possible
number of planes, the union of which contains S but does not include (0, 0, 0).
