1982/1. The function f (n) is defined for all positive integers n and takes on
non-negative integer values. Also, for all m, n
f (m + n) − f (m) − f (n) = 0 or 1
f (2) = 0, f (3) > 0, and f (9999) = 3333.
Determine f (1982).
1982/2. A non-isosceles triangle A1 A2 A3 is given with sides a1 , a2 , a3 (ai is
the side opposite Ai ). For all i = 1, 2, 3, Mi is the midpoint of side ai , and Ti .
is the point where the incircle touches side ai . Denote by Si the reflection
of Ti in the interior bisector of angle Ai . Prove that the lines M1 , S1 , M2 S2 ,
and M3 S3 are concurrent.
1982/3. Consider the infinite sequences {xn } of positive real numbers with
the following properties:

1982/4. Prove that if n is a positive integer such that the equation
x3 − 3xy 2 + y 3 = n
has a solution in integers (x, y), then it has at least three such solutions.
Show that the equation has no solutions in integers when n = 2891.
1982/5. The diagonals AC and CE of the regular hexagon ABCDEF are
divided by the inner points M and N , respectively, so that

Determine r if B, M, and N are collinear.

1982/6. Let S be a square with sides of length 100, and let L be a path
within S which does not meet itself and which is composed of line segments
A0 A1 , A1 A2 , · · · , An−1 An with A0 6= An . Suppose that for every point P of
the boundary of S there is a point of L at a distance from P not greater than
1/2. Prove that there are two points X and Y in L such that the distance
between X and Y is not greater than 1, and the length of that part of L
which lies between X and Y is not smaller than 198.
