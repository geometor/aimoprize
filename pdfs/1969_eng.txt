Prove that there are infinitely many natural numbers a with the following
property: the number z = n4 + a is not prime for any natura1 number n.

Given that f (x1 ) = f (x2 ) = 0, prove that x2 − x1 = mπ for some integer m.

1969/3.
For each value of k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, find necessary and sufficient conditions on
the number a > 0 so that there exists a tetrahedron with k edges of length
a, and the remaining 6 − k edges of length 1.

1969/4.
A semicircular arc γ is drawn on AB as diameter. C is a point on γ other
than A and B, and D is the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB. We
consider three circles, γ1 , γ2 , γ3 , all tangent to the line AB. Of these, γ1 is
inscribed in ∆ABC, while γ2 and γ3 are both tangent to CD and to γ, one on
each side of CD. Prove that γ1 , γ2 and γ3 have a second tangent in common.

1969/5.
Given n > 4 points³ in ´the plane such that no three are collinear. Prove that
there are at least n−3
convex quadrilaterals whose vertices are four of the

Prove that for all real numbers x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 , z1 , z2 , with x1 > 0, x2 > 0, x1 y1 −
