Problem 1. Let n > 100 be an integer. Ivan writes the numbers n, n + 1, . . . , 2n each on different
cards. He then shuffles these n + 1 cards, and divides them into two piles. Prove that at least one of
the piles contains two cards such that the sum of their numbers is a perfect square.
Problem 2.

Show that the inequality
n ∑
n √
n ∑
n √
∑
∑
|xi − xj | 6
|xi + xj |
i=1 j=1

i=1 j=1

holds for all real numbers x1 , . . . , xn .
Problem 3. Let D be an interior point of the acute triangle ABC with AB > AC so that ∠DAB =
∠CAD. The point E on the segment AC satisfies ∠ADE = ∠BCD, the point F on the segment
AB satisfies ∠F DA = ∠DBC, and the point X on the line AC satisfies CX = BX. Let O1 and O2
be the circumcentres of the triangles ADC and EXD, respectively. Prove that the lines BC, EF ,
and O1 O2 are concurrent.

Problem 4. Let Γ be a circle with centre I, and ABCD a convex quadrilateral such that each of
the segments AB, BC, CD and DA is tangent to Γ. Let Ω be the circumcircle of the triangle AIC.
The extension of BA beyond A meets Ω at X, and the extension of BC beyond C meets Ω at Z.
The extensions of AD and CD beyond D meet Ω at Y and T , respectively. Prove that
AD + DT + T X + XA = CD + DY + Y Z + ZC.
Problem 5. Two squirrels, Bushy and Jumpy, have collected 2021 walnuts for the winter. Jumpy
numbers the walnuts from 1 through 2021, and digs 2021 little holes in a circular pattern in the
ground around their favourite tree. The next morning Jumpy notices that Bushy had placed one
walnut into each hole, but had paid no attention to the numbering. Unhappy, Jumpy decides to
reorder the walnuts by performing a sequence of 2021 moves. In the k-th move, Jumpy swaps the
positions of the two walnuts adjacent to walnut k.
Prove that there exists a value of k such that, on the k-th move, Jumpy swaps some walnuts a
and b such that a < k < b.
Problem 6. Let m > 2 be an integer, A be a finite set of (not necessarily positive) integers, and
B1 , B2 , B3 , . . . , Bm be subsets of A. Assume that for each k = 1, 2, . . . , m the sum of the elements of
Bk is mk . Prove that A contains at least m/2 elements.
