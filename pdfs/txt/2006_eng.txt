Problem 1. Let ABC be a triangle with incentre I. A point P in the interior of the
triangle satisfies
6 P BA + 6 P CA = 6 P BC + 6 P CB.
Show that AP ≥ AI, and that equality holds if and only if P = I.
Problem 2. Let P be a regular 2006-gon. A diagonal of P is called good if its endpoints
divide the boundary of P into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of P .
The sides of P are also called good .
Suppose P has been dissected into triangles by 2003 diagonals, no two of which have
a common point in the interior of P . Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles
having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration.
Problem 3. Determine the least real number M such that the inequality
ab(a2 − b2 ) + bc(b2 − c2 ) + ca(c2 − a2 ) ≤ M (a2 + b2 + c2 )2
holds for all real numbers a, b and c.

Problem 4. Determine all pairs (x, y) of integers such that
1 + 2x + 22x+1 = y 2 .
Problem 5. Let P (x) be a polynomial of degree n > 1 with integer coefficients and let
k be a positive integer. Consider the polynomial Q(x) = P (P (. . . P (P (x)) . . .)), where P
occurs k times. Prove that there are at most n integers t such that Q(t) = t.
Problem 6. Assign to each side b of a convex polygon P the maximum area of a triangle
that has b as a side and is contained in P . Show that the sum of the areas assigned to
the sides of P is at least twice the area of P .
