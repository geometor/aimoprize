1972/1.
Prove that from a set of ten distinct two-digit numbers (in the decimal system), it is possible to select two disjoint subsets whose members have the
same sum.

1972/2.
Prove that if n ≥ 4, every quadrilateral that can be inscribed in a circle can
be dissected into n quadrilaterals each of which is inscribable in a circle.

1972/3.
Let m and n be arbitrary non-negative integers. Prove that
(2m)!(2n)!
m0n!(m + n)!
is an integer. (0! = 1.)

1972/4.

(x21 − x3 x5 )(x22 − x3 x5 )
(x22 − x4 x1 )(x23 − x4 x1 )
(x23 − x5 x2 )(x24 − x5 x2 )

where x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 are positive real numbers.

1972/5.
Let f and g be real-valued functions defined for all real values of x and y,
and satisfying the equation
f (x + y) + f (x − y) = 2f (x)g(y)
for all x, y. Prove that if f (x) is not identically zero, and if |f (x)| ≤ 1 for all
x, then |g(y)| ≤ 1 for all y.
